## Date: 2nd October 2019

## Agenda
1. Intro
2. Automation anywhere architechture
3. Web control room
4. Bot creator
5. Bot runner
6. Best Practice and techniques


# Intro
* Bot insight -> analytics platform
* Rpa platform -> task and meta bot, meta bot is the advanced version of the task bot
* Cognitive platform-> IQ bot 

# RPA platform
* Rule based
* front end automation
* Multi system integration
* Structured Data

# Cognitive platform
* Algorith based decision
* self learning activity
* Vision,NLP
* Semi structured data
* Dark data ->semi structured(pdf,images) or unstructured , 80 % data is in this form
* IQ bots helps to work on semi structured or unstructred data
* ML and AI abilities are supported with IQ bots

# Analytics Platform
* Provides business insights
* measures effectiveness
* make scaling decisions
* how much should be invest to make sure revnue is being generated

# Able to automate
* reading data from certain platform and writing to another
* works both for web bases and desktop based
* works awesome with Structured Data and good with semi-structured
* rule based decisions

# lacks
* Not able to work with handwritten data
* non rule based general calls

# Notes
* Once bot is set up on control room then it can be used to all other machines connected with same control room
* There are 2 types of clint: 
  1. Development Client -> bot creators
  2. Runtime Client -> bot execution, required once the bot is deployed to control room
* v-10.5, 8GB of RAM is required, CLient only would require 4gb RAM
* current version-: 11.3.3
* Control room is equipped with lots of tools and activities, its different in version 11 then 10
* AA community is applicable only for 1 month
* License in AA are customized thus can be developed based on requirements and charges will be applicable as per the needs
* To execute or use the Control Room , we require License to be uploaded on server through the control room application only
* Bots can be scheduled to be execute at certain time only
* autologin feature -> it allows the machine to unlock the software, login the client and do the automated tasks

# Runtime Client
* It is classified into 2 catgories:
  1. Attended -> Requires human interaction
  2. Unattended -> no human interaction required
