## Install Docker CE using Repository in Ubuntu
1. Update the ```apt``` package index
    ```sudo apt-get update```
2. install packages to allow ```apt``` to use a repository over HTTPS:
    ```sh
    sudo apt-get install \
    apt-transport-https \
    ca-certificates \
    curl \
    gnupg-agent \
    software-properties-common
    ```
3. Add Docker's official GPG key:
    ```sh
    curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -
    ```
    * Verify that you have the required key using
    ```sh
    sudo apt-key fingerprint 0EBFCD88
    ```
    it will show an output like
    ```
    pub   rsa4096 2017-02-22 [SCEA]
    9DC8 5822 9FC7 DD38 854A  E2D8 8D81 803C 0EBF CD88
    uid           [ unknown] Docker Release (CE deb) <docker@docker.com>
    sub   rsa4096 2017-02-22 [S]
    ```
4. Use the following command to set up stable repository
    ```sh
    sudo add-apt-repository \
   "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
   bionic \
   stable"
    ```

## Install Docker Engine - Community
1. Update the ```apt``` package index
    ```sh
    sudo apt-get update
    ```
2. Install the latest version of Docker Engine-Community and containerd,or go to the next step to install a specific version
    ```sh
    sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io
    ```
    * To list versions available in your repo: 
```apt-cache madison docker-ce```
    * for specific installation : ``` sudo apt-get install docker-ce=<VERSION_STRING> docker-ce-cli=<VERSION_STRING> containerd.io```
    * e.g., version_string = 5:18.09.1~3-0~ubuntu
    
3. Start the service ```sudo service docker start```


## Setup non-root user to access Docker without Sudo
1. If not created, create a docker group
    ```sudo groupadd docker```
2. Add your user to the group ```docker```
    ```sudo usermod -aG docker user-name```
3. Restart / Re-evaluate the user permissions by running the command
    ```newgrp docker```
4. Verify that docker is installed properly by running the command
    ```sh
    docker run hello-world
    ```
Note: if above command does not work,run ```docker login``` command and enter your docker hub credentials.


## Docker Containers
* There are different ways to use containers. These include:
    1. To run a single task ~> This could be a shell script or a custom app
    2. Interactively ~> This connects you to the container similar to the way you SSH into a remote server
    3. In the Background ~> For long-running services like websites and databases

1. Running a Single Task
* ```docker container run alpine hostname```
The output below shows that the alpine:latest image could not be found locally. When this happens, Docker automatically pulls it from Docker Hub.

After the image is pulled, the containerâ€™s hostname is displayed (888e89a3b36b in the example below).
```sh
 Unable to find image 'alpine:latest' locally
 latest: Pulling from library/alpine
 88286f41530e: Pull complete
 Digest: sha256:f006ecbb824d87947d0b51ab8488634bf69fe4094959d935c0c103f4820a417d
 Status: Downloaded newer image for alpine:latest
 888e89a3b36b
 ```
 * List all containers using 
    ```docker container ls --all```

2. Run an Interactive Ubuntu container
    * Run a Docker container and access its shell
    ```docker container run --interactive --tty --rm ubuntu bash```
    * In this example,we're giving Docker three parameters:

        1. ```--interactive``` says you want an interactive session
        2. ```--tty``` allocates a pseudo-tty
        3. ```--rm``` tells Docker to go ahead and remove the container when its done executing( such that when we again run ```docker container ls --all``` we won't find this container in the list)

```Note``` : Linux containers require the Docker host to be running a Linux kernel that is Linux containers cannot run directly on Windows Docker hosts and the same is true for Windows containers - they need to run on a Docker host with a Windows kernel

3. Run a background MySQL container
* Run a new MYSQL container with the following command
```sh
docker container run \
--detach\
--name mydb \
-e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=my-secret-pw \
mysql:latest
```
* In the above command:
    1. ```\``` allows to run command in different lines
    2. ```--detach``` will run the container in the background
    3. ```--name``` will name it mydb
    3. ```-e``` will use an environment variable to specify the root password (Note: This should never be done in production)
* To check whats happening inside docker container, we have two options:
    1. ```docker container logs container-name```
    2. ```docker container top container-name```
* ```docker container exec``` allows you to run a command inside a container.
* for example
```sh
docker exec -it mydb mysql --user=root --password=$MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD --version
```
* You can also use ```docker container exec``` to connect to a new shell process inside an already-running container. Executing the command below will give you an interactive shell (sh) inside your MySQL container
    ```docker exec -it mydb sh```

## Package and run a custom app using Docker

1. Build a Simple Website image using ```Dockerfile```
* pre-requisite: ```git clone https://github.com/dockersamples/linux_tweet_ap``` 
* Example of Dockerfile
```sh
FROM nginx:latest

COPY index.html /usr/share/nginx/html
COPY linux.png /usr/share/nginx/html

EXPOSE 80 443

CMD ["nginx","-g","daemon off;"]
```
* Lets see what each of these lines in the Dockerfile do:
    * ```FROM``` specifies the base image to use as the starting point for this new image you're creating
    * ```COPY``` copies files from the Docker host into the image, at a known location.
    In this example, ```COPY``` is used to copy two files into the image: ```index.html``` and a graphic that will be used on our webpage
    * ```EXPOSE``` documents which ports the application uses
    * ```CMD``` specifies what command to run when a container is started from the image.Notice that we can specify the command,as well as run-time arguments
* Use the ```docker image build``` command to create a new Docker image using the instructions in the Dockerfile
    ```docker image build --tag docker-id/image-name:version```
* To publish a website/image on some port, we use ```--publish``` tag
* The format of the ```--publish``` flag is ```host_port:container_port```
* Run the following command
```sh
docker container run \
 --detach \
 --publish 80:80 \
 --name linux_tweet_app \
 $DOCKERID/linux_tweet_app:1.0
 ```
 * to shutdown and remove the above container,run the following command
 ```docker container rm --force linux_tweet_app```
 * Here the ```--force``` parameter is used to remove the running container without shutting down
 * In production environment, use the ```docker container stop container-name``` to stop the container and use ```docker container rm container-name``` to permanently remove it
